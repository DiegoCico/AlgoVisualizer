## Overview

The **Sorting Visualization Tool** is a Python application that graphically demonstrates how various sorting algorithms work. It helps users understand the mechanics behind each algorithm through dynamic visualizations and interactive controls.

## Features

- **Visual Representation**: See sorting algorithms in action with real-time graphics.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Choose from a variety of sorting methods to explore.
- **Interactive Controls**: Navigate through sorting steps with ease.
- **Educational Tool**: Ideal for students and educators to teach sorting concepts.

## Sorting Algorithms

| Algorithm                  | Description                                                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Selection Sort**         | Selects the minimum element from the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first unsorted element.         |
| **Bubble Sort**            | Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.|
| **Insertion Sort**         | Builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting elements into their correct position.             |
| **Heap Sort**              | Utilizes a binary heap data structure to sort elements efficiently.                                        |
| **Quick Sort**             | Employs the divide-and-conquer strategy by selecting a pivot element and partitioning the array.             |
| **Merge Sort**             | Divides the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.                    |
| **Shell Sort**             | An optimization of insertion sort that allows the exchange of items far apart by using a gap sequence.         |
| **Counting Sort**          | Counts the number of occurrences of each unique element and calculates positions based on counts.            |
| **Radix Sort**             | Sorts numbers digit by digit starting from the least significant digit to the most significant.              |
| **Cocktail Shaker Sort**   | A variation of bubble sort that sorts in both directions on each pass through the list.                      |

## Interactive Controls

Each visualization window includes the following controls:

- **Play**: Automatically progresses through the sorting steps.
- **Stop**: Halts the automatic progression.
- **Back**: Reverts the visualization to the previous step.
- **Forward**: Advances the visualization to the next step.
